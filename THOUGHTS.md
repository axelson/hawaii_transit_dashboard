We should show:
* A grade (such as A, B, F). This will show if we're doing "good" overall
* A grade relative to rest of the US (maybe)
* Current slope (negative or positive)

Main thing to show:
* The current number (I think everything will be quantifiable)
* The current trendline
* An easy way to get to the graph and maybe a sparkline
